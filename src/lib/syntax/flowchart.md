# Flowcharts - Basic Syntax

Flowcharts are composed of **nodes** (geometric shapes) and **edges** (arrows or lines). The Mermaid code defines how nodes and edges are made and accommodates different arrow types, multi-directional arrows, and any linking to and from subgraphs.

> **Warning**
> If you are using the word "end" in a Flowchart node, capitalize the entire word or any of the letters (e.g., "End" or "END"), or apply this [workaround](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/1444#issuecomment-639528897). Typing "end" in all lowercase letters will break the Flowchart.

### A node (default)

```mermaid-example
---
title: Node
---
flowchart LR
    id
```

```mermaid
---
title: Node
---
flowchart LR
    id
```

> **Note**
> The id is what is displayed in the box.

> **💡 Tip**
> Instead of `flowchart` one can also use `graph`.

### A node with text

It is also possible to set text in the box that differs from the id. If this is done several times, it is the last text
found for the node that will be used. Also if you define edges for the node later on, you can omit text definitions. The
one previously defined will be used when rendering the box.

```mermaid-example
---
title: Node with text
---
flowchart LR
    id1[This is the text in the box]
```

```mermaid
---
title: Node with text
---
flowchart LR
    id1[This is the text in the box]
```

#### Unicode text

Use `"` to enclose the unicode text.

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id["This ❤ Unicode"]
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id["This ❤ Unicode"]
```

#### Markdown formatting

Use double quotes and backticks "\` text \`" to enclose the markdown text.

```mermaid-example
%%{init: {"flowchart": {"htmlLabels": false}} }%%
flowchart LR
    markdown["`This **is** _Markdown_`"]
    newLines["`Line1
    Line 2
    Line 3`"]
    markdown --> newLines
```

```mermaid
%%{init: {"flowchart": {"htmlLabels": false}} }%%
flowchart LR
    markdown["`This **is** _Markdown_`"]
    newLines["`Line1
    Line 2
    Line 3`"]
    markdown --> newLines
```

### Direction

This statement declares the direction of the Flowchart.

This declares the flowchart is oriented from top to bottom (`TD` or `TB`).

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    Start --> Stop
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start --> Stop
```

This declares the flowchart is oriented from left to right (`LR`).

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    Start --> Stop
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Start --> Stop
```

Possible FlowChart orientations are:

- TB - Top to bottom
- TD - Top-down/ same as top to bottom
- BT - Bottom to top
- RL - Right to left
- LR - Left to right

## Node shapes

### A node with round edges

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1(This is the text in the box)
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1(This is the text in the box)
```

### A stadium-shaped node

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1([This is the text in the box])
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1([This is the text in the box])
```

### A node in a subroutine shape

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1[[This is the text in the box]]
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1[[This is the text in the box]]
```

### A node in a cylindrical shape

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1[(Database)]
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1[(Database)]
```

### A node in the form of a circle

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1((This is the text in the circle))
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1((This is the text in the circle))
```

### A node in an asymmetric shape

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1>This is the text in the box]
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1>This is the text in the box]
```

Currently only the shape above is possible and not its mirror. _This might change with future releases._

### A node (rhombus)

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1{This is the text in the box}
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1{This is the text in the box}
```

### A hexagon node

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1{{This is the text in the box}}
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1{{This is the text in the box}}
```

### Parallelogram

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    id1[/This is the text in the box/]
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    id1[/This is the text in the box/]
```

### Parallelogram alt

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    id1[\This is the text in the box\]
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    id1[\This is the text in the box\]
```

### Trapezoid

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    A[/Christmas\]
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[/Christmas\]
```

### Trapezoid alt

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    B[\Go shopping/]
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    B[\Go shopping/]
```

### Double circle

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    id1(((This is the text in the circle)))
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    id1(((This is the text in the circle)))
```

## Links between nodes

Nodes can be connected with links/edges. It is possible to have different types of links or attach a text string to a link.

### A link with arrow head

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-->B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A-->B
```

### An open link

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A --- B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A --- B
```

### Text on links

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-- This is the text! ---B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A-- This is the text! ---B
```

or

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A---|This is the text|B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A---|This is the text|B
```

### A link with arrow head and text

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-->|text|B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A-->|text|B
```

or

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-- text -->B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A-- text -->B
```

### Dotted link

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A-.->B;
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A-.->B;
```

### Dotted link with text

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A-. text .-> B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A-. text .-> B
```

### Thick link

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A ==> B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A ==> B
```

### Thick link with text

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A == text ==> B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A == text ==> B
```

### An invisible link

This can be a useful tool in some instances where you want to alter the default positioning of a node.

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A ~~~ B
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A ~~~ B
```

### Chaining of links

It is possible declare many links in the same line as per below:

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A -- text --> B -- text2 --> C
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A -- text --> B -- text2 --> C
```

It is also possible to declare multiple nodes links in the same line as per below:

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   a --> b & c--> d
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   a --> b & c--> d
```
